To step it up, try a budget. If you have a one already, see how your real life spending matches up with what you budgeted. <pre></pre> No budget? Create one. It's a simple way to become more intentional about where you're putting your cash-and putting yourself on the path to bigger and better financial goals. (Our free <a href=\"https://spotlight.brightpeakfinancial.com/illuminate-app/\" target=\"_blank\">Illuminate</a> app can make this even easier.)"

Talking about life insurance or disability coverage may not be fun, but when others depend on you it's an important conversation to have. Creating a plan to live, give and save is an important step, and a good one to do with a trusted partner."

You check your balance (very) occasionally, but for the most part, you'd rather not know. <pre></pre> Unfortunately, dodging the money subject doesn't mean you're not worrying about it. In fact it might be weighing on you quite heavily. <pre></pre> Avoidance doesn't work, though, because money matters are a part of life for almost everyone. Ignoring them won't give you peace or a sense of security. That comes from living responsibly-starting with learning to face your finances. <pre></pre> It's okay not to be an expert. Money is something that has to be learned, and many people are never taught. Explore personal finance classes available in your community, or read an article on brightpeak.com. <pre></pre> Ultimately having a good grasp on how much money you have coming in and going out each month can be a powerful step towards getting in touch with your financial situation."

By avoiding reality, you could end up jeopardizing both your current and future happiness. <pre></pre> Financial denial is also associated with low self-esteem. If you feel like you have no control over your life in general, it can cause you to give up control in your financial life, too. If this sounds like you, think about what emotion is at the core of your unwillingness to face up to your finances. Is it fear of falling short? Shame that you don't know more about money?"

In fact, you'd rather not know than look your finances in the eye. <pre></pre> Chances are your avoidance comes down to fear. Maybe you feel like you don't deserve money or the stuff it buys. But whether you're procrastinating about future financial needs, like retirement, or just avoiding financial reality altogether, you could be jeopardizing your current and long-term happiness. <pre></pre> It's not uncommon to feel some stress around money. Increasing your financial knowledge can help. Many people have a fear about money because they've never really learned how to manage it. Something as simple as getting reliable information might make it less daunting. <pre></pre> You don't have to face it alone, either. Reach out to a family member you trust, or to a financial counselor, which you may even be able to access for free. <pre></pre> Choose today to take one small step forward-there's no need to dive into the deep end. One small step can start your momentum and help you build confidence, step by step, until you see that you can take on your money successfully."
